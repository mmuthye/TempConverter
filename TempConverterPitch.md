About
========================================================

This is a small application that converts a user input temperature 
from Centigrades or Celcius into Fahrenheits OR vice-a-versa.

User can also select a date from the date picker control, and prints the same.
Although the date has no link to the temperature, it as added only as fun element.

Relationship between Centigrade & Fahrenheits

- Select the temperature value by moving the slider

That's It!
